This error indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is set to restrict script execution, which prevents the json-server script from running.

Solution: Update PowerShell's Execution Policy
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Press Win + S, type "PowerShell", right-click on "Windows PowerShell", and select "Run as Administrator".
Check Current Execution Policy:

powershell
--------------->Get-ExecutionPolicy -List<----------------------
This will show the execution policy for different scopes.

Temporarily Allow Script Execution: You can bypass the restriction for the current session using:

powershell
------------------>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass<---------------------------
This allows script execution only for the current session and does not modify the system-wide policy.

Run Your Command: Now, retry running the json-server command:

powershell
-------------------->json-server --watch ecommerce.json<------------------------------------------
